      <description>I was inspired about SCRUM methodology back in 2018 when for the first time I read a book named &amp;ldquo;The SCRUM Field Guide&amp;rdquo; which written by Mitch Lacey. Back in the day I used to be an engineer and I could not realize all benefits of adapting this methodology and was blindly following what team lead was saying. Nowadays when I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of success of more than 20 people, that&amp;rsquo;s where I had to come back to this book and write down all important notes which I would like to share.</description>

      <description>General guidelines
✅ As the best practice we use the most affordable and efficient type of transportation and stays. The price of the stay and travel must be free or the provider has to pay our company for promoting them on tiktok. For those employees who didn’t reach 5 mln. subscribers and not able to get a bargain with the provider, the price of the stay and transportation must be covered by the employee.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s finally released 🎉 Use for social media: #MiniSpaceJourney
&amp;ldquo;Mini Space Journey&amp;rdquo; is an innovative game for the Apple Watch that takes players on a thrilling adventure through outer space. Instead of using the watch&amp;rsquo;s accelerometer and gyroscope, the game utilizes the unique crown button on the side of the watch to navigate the player&amp;rsquo;s spacecraft. This makes for a unique and interactive gaming experience that is not found in other Apple Watch games.</description>

      <description>Look dear readers, I’m not even suppose to write such an articles, since I’m an inspiring manager and have to motivate people becoming better and so on. I not going to lie right, manager in IT department has nothing to do with people motivation or being a great example for productivity. I play games and fuck it, I like it.
I used to fly quite a lot and still do and I was constantly looking for on-the-go solutions.</description>

      <description>Wfh - wtf? Working from home is post fake-pandemic trend which seems to make life of corpos even harder than paying higher taxes than others and feeding others because they became bigger and more successful than others, this is normal behavior of our undeveloped society and non-discipline minds. But what happened with small to medium bizes founded by entrepreneurs, who are real people and humans? This camp was divided into two extremes.</description>

      <description>Or how I moved with one backpack and half suitcase. Foreword This story has begun on 08.06 of 2021. The CEO of our company invited me to his office. We discussed my half year review and etc, and he put an offer in front of me. I went through, and I have to admit it was a nice package. But here is a small thing, I had to move to Luxembourg.</description>

      <description>I already posted a few thoughts about the iPad in the life of a developer. When I got a message from GitHub that I have beta access to codespaces I was super excited and started looking for a project which I can try to move to the cloud development environment to try it out. Due to the lack of small cozy projects which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require docker-compose with 10 services, the first thing which I setup here is my blog since it&amp;rsquo;s just Hugo.</description>

      <description>The year began with some optimism, I was a part of huge and important upcoming projects for the business of fashion, I had hard burnout after January due to being involved in a bunch of projects which we were trying to close from 2019. But we had a clear road map and new projects were super interesting to me, we had quite some freedom, clearly defined goals and high expertise was required to deliver them.</description>

      <description>Basic Building Blocks My blog and GitHub slightly empty in the past few months. I started spending less time on coding itself. I guess this happened to me naturally. I was a software engineer for the past five years and I was building amazing things in good teams and companies. I started to feel that I would like to help other people more than being focus on personal success.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I started spending much more of my spare time on our family project which is called basicbb - Basic Building Blocks.</description>

      <description>r/mk Due to quarantine, I had to set up my first home office. I never had anything at home except a laptop, because I can work anywhere, like in the office, cafe, park but not at ducking home. I have no idea how people can concentrate and don&amp;rsquo;t open the fridge every five minutes&amp;hellip; So, I had to suffer&amp;hellip; And I decided to adapt my small cabinet to trick my brain that I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the office.</description>

      <description>After I started working from home I got a bit more time to play games and would like to share my favorite ones. There are a few criteria by which I was compiling these lists. First of all, games should be optimized for the iPhone and iPad, games shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have bugs or unstable performance. And of course, keep in mind that it&amp;rsquo;s my taste and I would love to discover new projects - drop your favorite in comments below.</description>

      <description>I decided to share this thoughts, cause of purchasing new iPad pro. I was thinking for last few years, do I really need an iPad? I used to think that it&amp;rsquo;s completely useless device. If I have MacBook as main working machine and iPhone as secondary/helper. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about this device from programmer/manager perspective.
Zoom, right? MacBook has the shittiest camera on the market, for some of my coworkers it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound as disadvantage, because they simply don&amp;rsquo;t use camera for syncs and meetings.</description>

      <description>Logektor ⚡️ Forewords This repo has some background, let me tell about it. Once, quite some time ago, I came to the company on the interview, for quite good and interesting position. We were talking about what they need and what I will need to do on this position. Meeting it self was good and I was so excited about that position.
But after few days I received tests assignment from them.</description>

      <description>Forewords I needed a way to test mail confirmation. When you are dealing with deb authentication you would like to be sure that this email exist. And usually I use is_email_confirmed column next to user credentials in the database table. Once user hits siging endpoint as last step I send an email with confirmation token.
I was looking on few popular tools across the Internet:
https://mailtrap.io/ https://mailcow.email/ https://mailu.io/1.7/ https://poste.io/ What I found My requirements were: run in docker, easy to config, basic functionality to render email.</description>

      <description>Forewords I was doing hobby project, nothing special, server with authentication few endpoints and connection to database. I wrapped this project in docker to distribute project to another developer, he wanted to help with fronted but not that fluent at the backend part. Then I realized that my friend does not want to struggle with database setup and so on. So, solution was straight forward - docker-compose.
Problem I prefer using .</description>
