      <description>‚ÄúImproving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.‚Äù Gene Kim The Phoenix Project
Often as managers, we try to be a great example, lead by example and work as hard as we can and this is related to any leaders, team leads, managers, CEOs and etc. All of this is nice, but will never lead to great results, as a single person you cannot impact the results of the whole company, no matter how great, fast, experienced you are.</description>

      <description>I was inspired about SCRUM methodology back in 2018 when for the first time I read a book named &amp;ldquo;The SCRUM Field Guide&amp;rdquo; which written by Mitch Lacey. Back in the day I used to be an engineer and I could not realize all benefits of adapting this methodology and was blindly following what team lead was saying. Nowadays when I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of success of more than 20 people, that&amp;rsquo;s where I had to come back to this book and write down all important notes which I would like to share.</description>
