      <description>I was inspired about SCRUM methodology back in 2018 when for the first time I read a book named &amp;ldquo;The SCRUM Field Guide&amp;rdquo; which written by Mitch Lacey. Back in the day I used to be an engineer and I could not realize all benefits of adapting this methodology and was blindly following what team lead was saying. Nowadays when I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of success of more than 20 people, that&amp;rsquo;s where I had to come back to this book and write down all important notes which I would like to share.</description>
