      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my friends and colleagues are asking where I’m rushing, why I want to get promotions as fast as possible. Being a director in your twenties, when you suppose to drink, do stupid stuff and spend time with friends. I work effectively more than 12 hours every day, on my pet projects, main job and other side quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one important thing you need to accept and understand. Our brain has been representing a lot of important data wrongly since the beginning due to established patterns, especially the ones that are much easier to recognize. I will provide you with a few examples that were eye-opening for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ As the best practice we use the most affordable and efficient type of transportation and stays. The price of the stay and travel must be free or the provider has to pay our company for promoting them on tiktok. For those employees who didn’t reach 5 mln. subscribers and not able to get a bargain with the provider, the price of the stay and transportation must be covered by the employee. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s finally released 🎉 Use for social media: &lt;code&gt;#MiniSpaceJourney&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mini-space-journey/id1665989118?itsct=apps_box_badge&amp;amp;itscg=30200&#34; style=&#34;display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/download-on-the-app-store/black/en-us?size=250x83&amp;amp;releaseDate=1674345600&#34; alt=&#34;Download on the App Store&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mini Space Journey&amp;rdquo; is an innovative game for the Apple Watch that takes players on a thrilling adventure through outer space. Instead of using the watch&amp;rsquo;s accelerometer and gyroscope, the game utilizes the unique crown button on the side of the watch to navigate the player&amp;rsquo;s spacecraft. This makes for a unique and interactive gaming experience that is not found in other Apple Watch games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Look dear readers, I’m not even suppose to write such an articles, since I’m an inspiring manager and have to motivate people becoming better and so on. I not going to lie right, manager in IT department has nothing to do with people motivation or being a great example for productivity. I play games and fuck it, I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to fly quite a lot and still do and I was constantly looking for on-the-go solutions. For a while I was happy with iPad, but all the games there mostly arcade with zero story. Then I invested in Asus Rog Flow Z13, i9 and 3050ti on-the-fly sounds good right? Yeah, 1h of play for extra 3kilos on my back. This is so niche product that I’m still trying to sell it for half price.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;or-how-i-moved-with-one-backpack-and-half-suitcase&#34;&gt;Or how I moved with one backpack and half suitcase.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story has begun on 08.06 of 2021. The CEO of our company invited me to his office.
We discussed my half year review and etc, and he put an offer in front of me.
I went through, and I have to admit it was a nice package. But here is a small thing,
I had to move to Luxembourg. We had some talks about that before, so I was morally prepared.
Another country about which I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything, except it&amp;rsquo;s
one of the most expensive countries to live in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I already posted a few thoughts about the iPad in the life of a developer. When I got a message from GitHub that I have beta access to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/features/codespaces&#34;&gt;codespaces&lt;/a&gt; I was super excited and started looking for a project which I can try to move to the cloud development environment to try it out. Due to the lack of small cozy projects which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require docker-compose with 10 services, the first thing which I setup here is my blog since it&amp;rsquo;s just Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;basic-building-blocks&#34;&gt;Basic Building Blocks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog and GitHub slightly empty in the past few months. I started spending less time on coding itself. I guess this happened to me naturally. I was a software engineer for the past five years and I was building amazing things in good teams and companies. I started to feel that I would like to help other people more than being focus on personal success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I started spending much more of my spare time on our family project which is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://basicbb.com&#34;&gt;basicbb - Basic Building Blocks&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;../../tech-scaling/&#34;&gt;#TechScaling&lt;/a&gt; but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for the next post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Due to quarantine, I had to set up my first home office. I never had anything at home except a laptop, because I can work anywhere, like in the office, cafe, park but not at ducking home. I have no idea how people can concentrate and don&amp;rsquo;t open the fridge every five minutes&amp;hellip; So, I had to suffer&amp;hellip; And I decided to adapt my small cabinet to trick my brain that I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the office. I got a monitor, mouse, and vertical laptop holder to save someplace. Keyboard right? That&amp;rsquo;s how I found &lt;code&gt;r/mk&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip; I got hooked into that within my head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After I started working from home I got a bit more time to play games and would like to share my favorite ones. There are a few criteria by which I was compiling these lists. First of all, games should be optimized for the iPhone and iPad, games shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have bugs or unstable performance. And of course, keep in mind that it&amp;rsquo;s my taste and I would love to discover new projects - drop your favorite in comments below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During massive panic around the world I got stuck at home the same as a lot of other people probably. And a lot of my friends watching on me because not much changed in my life, I didn’t lose my job and I busy every day even due to massive panic which causes lockdown. So, they started asking me what should I do to become a developer like you and do millions per month?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>iPad - Do You Need It?</title>
      <link>https://mrpopov.com/posts/ipad-do-you-need-it/</link>

      <guid>https://mrpopov.com/posts/ipad-do-you-need-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to share this thoughts, cause of purchasing new iPad pro. I was thinking for last few years, do I really need an iPad? I used to think that it&amp;rsquo;s completely useless device. If I have MacBook as main working machine and iPhone as secondary/helper. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about this device from programmer/manager perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zoom-right&#34;&gt;Zoom, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacBook has the shittiest camera on the market, for some of my coworkers it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound as disadvantage, because they simply don&amp;rsquo;t use camera for syncs and meetings. True for programmers who sit in the most dark corner of the room. But for me it&amp;rsquo;s important to clearly see the person to whom I&amp;rsquo;m talking to. Hope I&amp;rsquo;m not only one who has this preferences. iPad has brilliant front camera for that kind of use and you can plug and play it to your zoom or any other conference apps. While you on the meeting via your iPad you can use your main laptop without any losses and slow downs. I hate how zoom opens on MacBook, it crashes time to time, on other hand on iPad I didn&amp;rsquo;t have such an experience - one tap and you online. If you use g-calendar + zoom, jitsi or any other meeting tools you can jump to the sync with one single tap, by moving your calendar to &amp;ldquo;Today View&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;forewords&#34;&gt;Forewords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repo has some background, let me tell about it. Once, quite some time ago, I came to the company on the interview, for quite good and interesting position. We were talking about what they need and what I will need to do on this position. Meeting it self was good and I was so excited about that position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after few days I received tests assignment from them. I was a bit confused, because for that kind of positions there is no test assignment usually. I was busy and working 24/7 in another company and had a business trip for 3 days (two days of the trip were weekend) that week and I told them about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
