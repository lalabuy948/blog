This case study provides examples of my experience in rebuilding IT and product departments.
The lessons learned include advice on identifying business domains and splitting teams, adjusting existing methodologies, identifying product streams, seeking external consultancy, prioritising people growth, and setting strategy. This case study offers insights that could be useful for other companies looking to improve their software development processes and strategies.
