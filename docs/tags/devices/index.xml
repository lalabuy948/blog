      <description>I used to flight quite a lot in the past, due to last year it stopped for a while, but now I’m back in-game. A lot of my colleagues and acquaintances complaining about business trips and how it’s hard to flight every second week. To be honest I disagree with the statement that flights are exhausting. I would like to share my way of doing it and what I take with me on every business trip to flight with pleasure.</description>

      <description>I decided to share this thoughts, cause of purchasing new iPad pro. I was thinking for last few years, do I really need an iPad? I used to think that it&amp;rsquo;s completely useless device. If I have MacBook as main working machine and iPhone as secondary/helper. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about this device from programmer/manager perspective.
Zoom, right? MacBook has the shittiest camera on the market, for some of my coworkers it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound as disadvantage, because they simply don&amp;rsquo;t use camera for syncs and meetings.</description>
