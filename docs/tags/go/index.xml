      <description>Im web engineer with passion in scalable and high-loaded systems. Currently I have title of Technical Team Lead. In the past I used to work as research agent, freelancing and I&#39;ve started few startups. I used to work on quite a few web projects with primary focus on backend, architecture and data storages. I dont have prefered technology, In my opinion you have to choose language or specific technology based on your problem.</description>
