      <description>&lt;p&gt;I already posted a few thoughts about the iPad in the life of a developer. When I got a message from GitHub that I have beta access to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/features/codespaces&#34;&gt;codespaces&lt;/a&gt; I was super excited and started looking for a project which I can try to move to the cloud development environment to try it out. Due to the lack of small cozy projects which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require docker-compose with 10 services, the first thing which I setup here is my blog since it&amp;rsquo;s just Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
