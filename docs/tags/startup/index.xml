      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;basic-building-blocks&#34;&gt;Basic Building Blocks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog and GitHub slightly empty in the past few months. I started spending less time on coding itself. I guess this happened to me naturally. I was a software engineer for the past five years and I was building amazing things in good teams and companies. I started to feel that I would like to help other people more than being focus on personal success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I started spending much more of my spare time on our family project which is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://basicbb.com&#34;&gt;basicbb - Basic Building Blocks&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;../../tech-scaling/&#34;&gt;#TechScaling&lt;/a&gt; but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for the next post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
