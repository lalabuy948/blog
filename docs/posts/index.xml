      <description>As you might feel hard times are approaching, failure of Silicon Valley Bank is not the only sign of what‚Äôs happening in the world. Enormous true inflation with a lot of excluded spheres in calculations and constant lie on reported numbers. The main question is how to protect yourself from upcoming ‚Äútsunami‚Äù, as some enlightened people are saying.
Stocks, crypto, commodities, real estate, different currencies - all of this might evaporate in matter of a blink.</description>

      <description>Most of my friends and colleagues are asking where I‚Äôm rushing, why I want to get promotions as fast as possible. Being a director in your twenties, when you suppose to drink, do stupid stuff and spend time with friends. I work effectively more than 12 hours every day, on my pet projects, main job and other side quests.
Here is one important thing you need to accept and understand. Our brain has been representing a lot of important data wrongly since the beginning due to established patterns, especially the ones that are much easier to recognize.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;This story happened to me yesterday. My sister and I have birthdays quite close to each other, with only a 6-day difference. Since I&amp;rsquo;m living abroad, we&amp;rsquo;ve celebrated together at our parents&amp;rsquo; place for the past couple of years. And since it&amp;rsquo;s their place, they sometimes invite their friends to such events as an extra occasion to reunite with them. This time, they invited one of their friends who is somewhat welcome, but we always hope she will cancel her invite, you know, being polite and all this stupid shit human bags are doing.</description>

      <description>Why would we even need something like user stories? Based on my view this is an intermediate state of information between long and boring business summaries and technical tickets. In my cycle of articles about IT management we spoke about SCRUM and we discussed about process, responsibilities and etc. but we didn&amp;rsquo;t discuss actual challenges which we are solving. There are users, users have needs, based on that needs certain services and products are being developed.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúImproving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.‚Äù Gene Kim The Phoenix Project
Often as managers, we try to be a great example, lead by example and work as hard as we can and this is related to any leaders, team leads, managers, CEOs and etc. All of this is nice, but will never lead to great results, as a single person you cannot impact the results of the whole company, no matter how great, fast, experienced you are.</description>

      <guid>https://mrpopov.com/posts/a-bit-about-scrum-and-its-history/</guid>
      <description>I was inspired about SCRUM methodology back in 2018 when for the first time I read a book named &amp;ldquo;The SCRUM Field Guide&amp;rdquo; which written by Mitch Lacey. Back in the day I used to be an engineer and I could not realize all benefits of adapting this methodology and was blindly following what team lead was saying. Nowadays when I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of success of more than 20 people, that&amp;rsquo;s where I had to come back to this book and write down all important notes which I would like to share.</description>

      <description>Look dear readers, I‚Äôm not even suppose to write such an articles, since I‚Äôm an inspiring manager and have to motivate people becoming better and so on.

Working from home is post fake-pandemic trend which seems to make life of corpos even harder than paying higher taxes than others and feeding others because they became bigger and more successful than others, this is normal behavior of our undeveloped society and non-discipline minds.¬†But what happened with small to medium bizes founded by entrepreneurs, who are real people and humans?

      <description>Or how I moved with one backpack and half suitcase. Foreword This story has begun on 08.06 of 2021. The CEO of our company invited me to his office. We discussed my half year review and etc, and he put an offer in front of me. I went through, and I have to admit it was a nice package. But here is a small thing, I had to move to Luxembourg.</description>

      <description>I already posted a few thoughts about the iPad in the life of a developer. When I got a message from GitHub that I have beta access to codespaces I was super excited and started looking for a project which I can try to move to the cloud development environment to try it out. Due to the lack of small cozy projects which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require docker-compose with 10 services, the first thing which I setup here is my blog since it&amp;rsquo;s just Hugo.</description>

      <description>Basic Building Blocks My blog and GitHub slightly empty in the past few months. I started spending less time on coding itself. I guess this happened to me naturally. I was a software engineer for the past five years and I was building amazing things in good teams and companies. I started to feel that I would like to help other people more than being focus on personal success.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I started spending much more of my spare time on our family project which is called basicbb - Basic Building Blocks.</description>

      <description>I decided to share this thoughts, cause of purchasing new iPad pro. I was thinking for last few years, do I really need an iPad? I used to think that it&amp;rsquo;s completely useless device. If I have MacBook as main working machine and iPhone as secondary/helper. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about this device from programmer/manager perspective.
Zoom, right? MacBook has the shittiest camera on the market, for some of my coworkers it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound as disadvantage, because they simply don&amp;rsquo;t use camera for syncs and meetings.</description>

      <description>Forewords I needed a way to test mail confirmation. When you are dealing with deb authentication you would like to be sure that this email exist. And usually I use is_email_confirmed column next to user credentials in the database table. Once user hits siging endpoint as last step I send an email with confirmation token.
I was looking on few popular tools across the Internet:
https://mailtrap.io/ https://mailcow.email/ https://mailu.io/1.7/ https://poste.io/ What I found My requirements were: run in docker, easy to config, basic functionality to render email.</description>
