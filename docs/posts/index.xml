      <title>Elixir Liveview Single Binary</title>
      <link>https://mrpopov.com/posts/elixir-liveview-single-binary/</link>

      <guid>https://mrpopov.com/posts/elixir-liveview-single-binary/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had two repos of Elixir, seventy-five LiveView components, five sheets of high-powered Phoenix channels, a saltshaker half-full of SQLite databases, and a whole multicolored collection of Burrito deployables, Tauri binaries, WebView wrappers, hot-reloaders&amp;hellip; Also, a quart of WebSockets, a quart of GenServers, a case of Ecto queries, a pint of raw BEAM bytecode, and two dozen supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that really worried me was the WebView. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a developer in the depths of a cross-platform binge, and I knew we&amp;rsquo;d get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;Delaware (strong legal framework)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://livebook.dev&#34;&gt;Livebook&lt;/a&gt; is very powerful application which can be used in many different ways with your &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.phoenixframework.org&#34;&gt;Phoneix&lt;/a&gt; project.
I have few apps running on my VPS and sometimes I would like to run some functions without creating interface for them from admin side, such as cache clean up. Perhaps run some analytical queries to the database and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I found this library on github suggestions and I always wanted to have something simple and quick to test out LiveView prototypes. What can be quicker than opening Livebook and trying something there? Folks behind &lt;a href=&#34;https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_playground/readme.html&#34;&gt;PhonenixPlayground&lt;/a&gt; made both of my wishes come true!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 5 Things I Learned as Entrepreneur</title>
      <link>https://mrpopov.com/posts/top-5-things-i-learned-as-entrepreneur/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 14:43:13 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mrpopov.com/posts/top-5-things-i-learned-as-entrepreneur/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, I opened my own LLC to run a fractional CTO/consulting business. After almost a year, I learned some important things that could be useful for people who would like to make a change in their career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-never-trust-anyone-unless-the-contract-is-signed-and-the-invoice-is-paid&#34;&gt;1. Never trust anyone unless the contract is signed and the invoice is paid.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title says, a potential client might be eager to work with you, but when it comes to the actual contract and work, they might suddenly disappear without any signs of life, even people with whom you thought you had a nice relationship. Lower your expectations to zero or sometimes below zero. Once the contract is signed and the invoice is paid, you can have a small relief. (This happened to me 9 out of 10 times, maybe something is wrong with me)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Continuous Improvement Culture</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-establish-a-culture-of-continuous-improvement-across-whole-company&#34;&gt;How to establish a culture of continuous improvement across whole company?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why it’s even important to have continuous improvement culture in your company? For example, if you read a book for 15 minutes daily you already read more than majority of people aged between 15 to 44. Just fifteen minutes a day may put you ahead of competition and this result will be multiplied through the period of time. Same works in business, teams of personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-you-want-to-create-stunning-presentations-in-just-15-minutes&#34;&gt;Do you want to create stunning presentations in just 15 minutes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often when you need to make presentation it becomes entire saga of preparations, updates and fixes? All of it because you use wrong process and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dive a bit into the process of creating a presentation. In most cases, you are on a call where 80% of the content is delivered verbally and only 20% is shown on the screen to highlight your thoughts. However, when preparing a presentation, you often spend 80% of your time creating only 20% of the content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of my friends and colleagues are asking where I’m rushing, why I want to get promotions as fast as possible. Being a director in your twenties, when you suppose to drink, do stupid stuff and spend time with friends. I work effectively more than 12 hours every day, on my pet projects, main job and other side quests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one important thing you need to accept and understand. Our brain has been representing a lot of important data wrongly since the beginning due to established patterns, especially the ones that are much easier to recognize. I will provide you with a few examples that were eye-opening for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you might feel hard times are approaching, failure of Silicon Valley Bank is not the only sign of what’s happening in the world. Enormous &lt;a href=&#34;https://truflation.com/&#34;&gt;https://truflation.com&lt;/a&gt; with a lot of excluded spheres in calculations and constant lie on reported numbers. The main question is how to protect yourself from upcoming “tsunami”, as some enlightened people are saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks, crypto, commodities, real estate, different currencies - all of this might evaporate in matter of a blink. Stocks unpredictable, crypto even worse. Commodities and real estate might nationalised. Any currency might hit hyper inflation or even if going to find a stable pair, you still need to do operations through banks which can refuse giving you real value back instead of digits on your phone screen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This story happened to me yesterday. My sister and I have birthdays quite close to each other, with only a 6-day difference. Since I&amp;rsquo;m living abroad, we&amp;rsquo;ve celebrated together at our parents&amp;rsquo; place for the past couple of years. And since it&amp;rsquo;s their place, they sometimes invite their friends to such events as an extra occasion to reunite with them. This time, they invited one of their friends who is somewhat welcome, but we always hope she will cancel her invite, you know, being polite and all this stupid shit human bags are doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>User Stories Explained</title>
      <link>https://mrpopov.com/posts/user-stories-explained/</link>

      <guid>https://mrpopov.com/posts/user-stories-explained/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why would we even need something like user stories? Based on my view this is an intermediate state of information between long and boring business summaries and technical tickets. In my cycle of articles about IT management we spoke about &lt;a href=&#34;../posts/a-bit-about-scrum-and-its-history/&#34;&gt;SCRUM&lt;/a&gt; and we discussed about process, responsibilities and etc. but we didn&amp;rsquo;t discuss actual challenges which we are solving. There are users, users have needs, based on that needs certain services and products are being developed. And to deliver solution to user we first need to write down an idea and transfer this idea to developers. Since modern software development is complex and its complexity has many reasons, one of the common challenges is to solve information complexity and one of the methods is to break down big peace of functionality into user stories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improve and Do Retrospectives Right</title>

&lt;p&gt;“Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work.”
&lt;strong&gt;Gene Kim&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project&#34;&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often as managers, we try to be a great example, lead by example and work as hard as we can and this is related to
any leaders, team leads, managers, CEOs and etc.
All of this is nice, but will never lead to great results, as a single person you cannot impact the results of the whole company,
no matter how great, fast, experienced you are. There is always a team and more than one person behind success. I stumbled upon one concept which is called &amp;ldquo;multiplier&amp;rdquo; from the same name book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8310410-multipliers&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Multipliers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, that was eye opening for me. Instead of pushing yourself you must educate and mentor others, as you will work as the &amp;ldquo;multiplier&amp;rdquo; and bring much more value towards the company/business/team/department.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://mrpopov.com/posts/a-bit-about-scrum-and-its-history/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was inspired about SCRUM methodology back in 2018 when for the first time I read a book named &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12426548-the-scrum-field-guide&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The SCRUM Field Guide&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; which written by Mitch Lacey. Back in the day I used to be an engineer and I could not realize all benefits of adapting this methodology and was blindly following what team lead was saying. Nowadays when I&amp;rsquo;m in charge of success of more than 20 people, that&amp;rsquo;s where I had to come back to this book and write down all important notes which I would like to share. As well as to share how and where scrum methodology and agile principles started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ As the best practice we use the most affordable and efficient type of transportation and stays. The price of the stay and travel must be free or the provider has to pay our company for promoting them on tiktok. For those employees who didn’t reach 5 mln. subscribers and not able to get a bargain with the provider, the price of the stay and transportation must be covered by the employee. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s finally released 🎉 Use for social media: &lt;code&gt;#MiniSpaceJourney&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mini-space-journey/id1665989118?itsct=apps_box_badge&amp;amp;itscg=30200&#34; style=&#34;display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/download-on-the-app-store/black/en-us?size=250x83&amp;amp;releaseDate=1674345600&#34; alt=&#34;Download on the App Store&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mini Space Journey&amp;rdquo; is an innovative game for the Apple Watch that takes players on a thrilling adventure through outer space. Instead of using the watch&amp;rsquo;s accelerometer and gyroscope, the game utilizes the unique crown button on the side of the watch to navigate the player&amp;rsquo;s spacecraft. This makes for a unique and interactive gaming experience that is not found in other Apple Watch games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Look dear readers, I’m not even suppose to write such an articles, since I’m an inspiring manager and have to motivate people becoming better and so on. I not going to lie right, manager in IT department has nothing to do with people motivation or being a great example for productivity. I play games and fuck it, I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to fly quite a lot and still do and I was constantly looking for on-the-go solutions. For a while I was happy with iPad, but all the games there mostly arcade with zero story. Then I invested in Asus Rog Flow Z13, i9 and 3050ti on-the-fly sounds good right? Yeah, 1h of play for extra 3kilos on my back. This is so niche product that I’m still trying to sell it for half price.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;wfh---wtf&#34;&gt;Wfh - wtf?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home is post fake-pandemic trend which seems to make life of corpos even harder than paying higher taxes than others and feeding others because they became bigger and more successful than others, this is normal behavior of our undeveloped society and non-discipline minds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happened with small to medium bizes founded by entrepreneurs, who are real people and humans? This camp was divided into two extremes. One says that only office and at least 40h in the office and others say “we don’t care where are you - home, office or Maldives, see you in zoom” just bring the results. And to be honest second camp is much smaller on the market. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story has begun on 08.06 of 2021. The CEO of our company invited me to his office.
We discussed my half year review and etc, and he put an offer in front of me.
I went through, and I have to admit it was a nice package. But here is a small thing,
I had to move to Luxembourg. We had some talks about that before, so I was morally prepared.
Another country about which I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything, except it&amp;rsquo;s
one of the most expensive countries to live in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I write around 2-3 important notes a day. And don&amp;rsquo;t actually worry if my laptop will be stolen, but the data on it..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Im heavy notion user I was looking for automated backup solution. Not that I don&amp;rsquo;t trust notion, trust but verify, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;backup&#34;&gt;Backup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I already posted a few thoughts about the iPad in the life of a developer. When I got a message from GitHub that I have beta access to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/features/codespaces&#34;&gt;codespaces&lt;/a&gt; I was super excited and started looking for a project which I can try to move to the cloud development environment to try it out. Due to the lack of small cozy projects which wouldn&amp;rsquo;t require docker-compose with 10 services, the first thing which I setup here is my blog since it&amp;rsquo;s just Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;basic-building-blocks&#34;&gt;Basic Building Blocks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog and GitHub slightly empty in the past few months. I started spending less time on coding itself. I guess this happened to me naturally. I was a software engineer for the past five years and I was building amazing things in good teams and companies. I started to feel that I would like to help other people more than being focus on personal success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I started spending much more of my spare time on our family project which is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://basicbb.com&#34;&gt;basicbb - Basic Building Blocks&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;../tech-scaling/&#34;&gt;#TechScaling&lt;/a&gt; but that&amp;rsquo;s a story for the next post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As you probably saw my founding of two nice libraries that allow you beauty and easy abstraction on dot and just environment variables. You can check it &lt;a href=&#34;../posts/flexible-env-in-go/&#34;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time I decided to create another open-source library for the world and I merged the functionality of packages which you can find in the article above. I started from scratch and you are more than welcome to have look on it on my GitHub -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lalabuy948/genvutils&#34;&gt;github.com/lalabuy948/genvutils&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Due to quarantine, I had to set up my first home office. I never had anything at home except a laptop, because I can work anywhere, like in the office, cafe, park but not at ducking home. I have no idea how people can concentrate and don&amp;rsquo;t open the fridge every five minutes&amp;hellip; So, I had to suffer&amp;hellip; And I decided to adapt my small cabinet to trick my brain that I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the office. I got a monitor, mouse, and vertical laptop holder to save someplace. Keyboard right? That&amp;rsquo;s how I found &lt;code&gt;r/mk&lt;/code&gt;&amp;hellip; I got hooked into that within my head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After I started working from home I got a bit more time to play games and would like to share my favorite ones. There are a few criteria by which I was compiling these lists. First of all, games should be optimized for the iPhone and iPad, games shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have bugs or unstable performance. And of course, keep in mind that it&amp;rsquo;s my taste and I would love to discover new projects - drop your favorite in comments below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And a lot of my friends watching on me because not much changed in my life, I didn’t lose my job and I busy every day even due to massive panic which causes lockdown. So, they started asking me what should I do to become a developer like you and do millions per month?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>iPad - Do You Need It?</title>

      <guid>https://mrpopov.com/posts/ipad-do-you-need-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to share this thoughts, cause of purchasing new iPad pro. I was thinking for last few years, do I really need an iPad? I used to think that it&amp;rsquo;s completely useless device. If I have MacBook as main working machine and iPhone as secondary/helper. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about this device from programmer/manager perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zoom-right&#34;&gt;Zoom, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacBook has the shittiest camera on the market, for some of my coworkers it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound as disadvantage, because they simply don&amp;rsquo;t use camera for syncs and meetings. True for programmers who sit in the most dark corner of the room. But for me it&amp;rsquo;s important to clearly see the person to whom I&amp;rsquo;m talking to. Hope I&amp;rsquo;m not only one who has this preferences. iPad has brilliant front camera for that kind of use and you can plug and play it to your zoom or any other conference apps. While you on the meeting via your iPad you can use your main laptop without any losses and slow downs. I hate how zoom opens on MacBook, it crashes time to time, on other hand on iPad I didn&amp;rsquo;t have such an experience - one tap and you online. If you use g-calendar + zoom, jitsi or any other meeting tools you can jump to the sync with one single tap, by moving your calendar to &amp;ldquo;Today View&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;forewords&#34;&gt;Forewords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repo has some background, let me tell about it. Once, quite some time ago, I came to the company on the interview, for quite good and interesting position. We were talking about what they need and what I will need to do on this position. Meeting it self was good and I was so excited about that position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after few days I received tests assignment from them. I was a bit confused, because for that kind of positions there is no test assignment usually. I was busy and working 24/7 in another company and had a business trip for 3 days (two days of the trip were weekend) that week and I told them about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Testing Mailer in Go</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;forewords&#34;&gt;Forewords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed a way to test mail confirmation. When you are dealing with deb authentication you would like to be sure that this email exist. And usually I use &lt;code&gt;is_email_confirmed&lt;/code&gt; column next to user credentials in the database table. Once user hits siging endpoint as last step I send an email with confirmation token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking on few popular tools across the Internet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mailtrap.io/&#34;&gt;https://mailtrap.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mailcow.email/&#34;&gt;https://mailcow.email/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mailu.io/1.7/&#34;&gt;https://mailu.io/1.7/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://poste.io/&#34;&gt;https://poste.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-found&#34;&gt;What I found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My requirements were: run in docker, easy to config, basic functionality to render email. All things above quite heavy apps with complex configuration. After that I found found nice and lightweight way how to test it locally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;forewords&#34;&gt;Forewords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing hobby project, nothing special, server with authentication few endpoints and connection to database.
I wrapped this project in docker to distribute project to another developer, he wanted to help with fronted but not that fluent at the backend part.
Then I realized that my friend does not want to struggle with database setup and so on. So, solution was straight forward - docker-compose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer using &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; instead of typing stuff to cli. I found out really elegant solution. You can still use &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; and parse it easily with
&lt;code&gt;github.com/caarlos0/env/v6&lt;/code&gt;, specify default values or even load file (certificates etc). But in docker-compose you need to specify same ports for database for example. Here comes &lt;code&gt;github.com/joho/godotenv&lt;/code&gt;, if you provide environment variables via dockerfile or docker-compose it will override constants in your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
