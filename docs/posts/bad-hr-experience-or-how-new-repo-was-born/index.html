<h2 id="forewords">Forewords</h2>
<p>This repo has some background, let me tell about it. Once, quite some time ago, I came to the company on the interview, for quite good and interesting position. We were talking about what they need and what I will need to do on this position. Meeting it self was good and I was so excited about that position.</p>
<p>But after few days I received tests assignment from them. I was a bit confused, because for that kind of positions there is no test assignment usually. I was busy and working 24/7 in another company and had a business trip for 3 days (two days of the trip were weekend) that week and I told them about it.</p>
<p>After a that I got an email where they were saying thanks for your effort but you failed tests assignment. Since I even didn&rsquo;t touch it. I was super disappointed&hellip; Company even didn&rsquo;t try to look into the situation.</p>
<p>I do not remember all requirements. But basically they asked to build high-loaded system to store tracking events. Few days ago I had an insomnia and build it within one night.</p>
<h2 id="few-words-about-app-architecture">Few words about app architecture</h2>
<p>Let me tell about architecture to prove you that I know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Since you need to track events from the website and after that show some reports, I decided to use kinda cqrs as global patter for this. We need high event throughput, that&rsquo;s why client in go (fasthttp) + Kafka. Workers which are storing that events in db are written in python, but it really doesn&rsquo;t matter, because I wanted to show that this architecture allows you to use polyglot approach. For database I used postgres to simplify the solution, but I would recommend something like clickhouse or redshift. Essentially column oriented databases. Each component of the system is designed in a way to be scaled and replaceable in the future. Need to change worker? Sure. Need to change warehouse? Go for that, replace it with Hadoop or whatever. I didn&rsquo;t create dashboard app, but maybe I will ask some frontend friend to help we with that in the future. I just wanted to show the principle and architecture.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-decided-to-share-this">Why I decided to share this?</h2>
<p>To show to other HR and lead people who in charge of hiring how you can lose a great future employee. Im not saying that I&rsquo;m a great future employee, I would not recommend myself :), just talking about my own experience. Might it&rsquo;s correct to follow some company&rsquo;s corporate laws and such but we are all people, unique people with diffirent situations in life and ffs for such positions you have to make an exceptions.</p>
<p>Not sure if it will be useful to anyone, but i decided to share it.</p>
