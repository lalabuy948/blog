So, I joined really good tech company few month ago. I though that this kind of companies don't exist, but no. And I would like to share minimal requirements for people who would like to work in . This is philosophical requirements, you will not see tech specs here such a Postgres or php 7.2, this is more about your behaviour.

First of all let me talk about mentoring. When I came I was mentored by team lead, senior guy and project manager. Do appreciate them, they invested their time and energy into you. Yes, they get paid for it, but you get paid as well. Be thankful for them that you are growing as professional and becoming more valuable for the project.

Second thing, Im backend developer and it means that I have to talk to people with whom Im doing the things. Don't be harsh or rude, all people are busy, try to understand it. If you see that something wrong in the code, try to say in polite way: "I saw that part and I would like to suggest a solution how to make it better". Or even organise an event for all backend developers and discuss the things together.


> If you call yourself developer, you will probably agree with me that we are egoistic people. We are creators, we developing complicated stuff and for people around we are geeks, right? But if we would say that the project is the world, we are coming to this world and start creating things in this world. But you have to accept rules of that world.


Please, do not complain that this technology sucks or this paradigm is better, you came to this world, accept the rules. Maximum you can do is to discuss or suggest something but do no complain, its dismoraling the people around.

No no no

```python
try:
	complicated_stuff()
except:
	# ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

Yes

```php
<?php

/**
 * @param array $userIds
 * @throws \Exception
 */
private function importSelectedUsers(array $userIds): void
```

Be on good vibes and people will do same for you.
