[My CV](/cv/)

Result-oriented Senior Software Engineer and fCTO with a proven track record. With over a decade of experience in technology, software development, people management, and process establishment, I have primarily led complex projects that are critical to entire systems, often requiring cross-department coordination. For example, I have overseen ERP migration and integration, as well as live feed migration for environments with millions of active users without service downtime. During my leadership, I increased engineering efficiency by more than twice in half a year and decreased tech debt by 45% in 1.5 years.

Recognized leader with strong software engineering skills, in-depth technology knowledge, and a business-first approach. Goal-oriented, innovative, trustworthy, reliable, self-motivated, and proactive.

Based in Luxembourg, I work remotely but am open to on-site visits.
