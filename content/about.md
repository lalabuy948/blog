In the past I used to work as research agent, full-stack engineer, technical team lead, project manager and business runner. I worked on quite a few IT projects with primary focus on business logic, architecture, system scaling, data flows and data storages. As every casual entrepreneur I have bunch of failed startups ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I don‚Äôt have preferred technology, In my opinion you have to choose language or specific technology based on your problem.

Do it best or don‚Äôt do it at all. Don't forget to procrastinate well. 
Why procrastinator? Im struggling with logically connecting things in chaos - entropy. 
That's why I think Im procrastinating.

If you find typo/mistake in my posts please write to me directly about it, I'm not a native speaker and would appreciate such a gesture from you.
