Originally from Saint-Petersburg, living in Slovenia. 
Im web engineer with passion for scalable and high-loaded systems. Currently I have title of Technical Team Lead on big media project. 
In the past I used to work as research agent, freelancer, fullstack developer and project manager.
I used to work on quite a few web projects with primary focus on backend, architecture and data storages.
I don't have preferred technology, In my opinion you have to choose language or specific technology based on your problem. 

Why procrastinator? Im struggling with logically connecting things in chaos - entropy. 
Thats why I think Im procrastinating.

If you find typo/mistake in my posts please write to me directly about it, I'm not a native speaker and would appreciate such a gesture from you.
