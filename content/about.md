Originally from Saint-Petersburg, living in Slovenia. 
Im web engineer with passion in scalable and high-loaded systems. Currently I have title of Technical Team Lead. 
In the past I used to work as research agent, freelancing and I've started few startups. 
I used to work on quite a few web projects with primary focus on backend, architecture and data storages.
I dont have prefered technology, In my opinion you have to choose language or specific technology based on your problem. 

Why procrastinator? Im struggling with logically connecting things in chaos - entropy. 
Thats why I think Im procrastinating.

If you find typo/mistake in my posts please write to me directly about it, I'm not a native speaker and would appreciate such a gesture from you.
