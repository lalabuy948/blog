Originally from Saint-Petersburg, used to live in Slovenia, currently living in Luxembourg. I’m software engineer / team lead / manager / head of IT with passion for scalable, distributed and high-loaded systems. In love with greek sculps, antique architecture, renaissance paintings and my muse of course.

Currently helping other companies and individuals to find balance between business and engineering. Technical stacks, technical debts, processes optimization and establishing, migration strategies and more.

In the past I used to work as research agent, full-stack engineer, technical team lead, project manager and business runner. I worked on quite a few IT projects with primary focus on business logic, architecture, system scaling, data flows and data storages.

I don’t have preferred technology, In my opinion you have to choose language or specific technology based on your problem.

Do it best or don’t do it at all. Don't forget to procrastinate well. 
Why procrastinator? Im struggling with logically connecting things in chaos - entropy. 
That's why I think Im procrastinating.

If you find typo/mistake in my posts please write to me directly about it, I'm not a native speaker and would appreciate such a gesture from you.
