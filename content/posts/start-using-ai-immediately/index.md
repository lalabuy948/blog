# Why you need to start using AI as soon as possible

Hey there, today we are talking why you need to start using AI now. Artificial Intelligence has been around for quite some time, and it's no longer a concept of the future. Many businesses are already leveraging AI to improve their operations and stay ahead of the competition.

In this post, I'll talk about the need for AI implementation, the benefits of AI, and why you should not afraid of it. So, let's dive right in.

## Why AI is Necessary

ChatGPT since it launched in November 2022. It took some time to test it out, polish here and there, add some censorship and now it became an information boom. 

But what happened in March 2023 AI is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. We live in a world where data is growing exponentially, and manual analysis is no longer efficient. AI technology can help you manage this data and gain insights that can help you make better business decisions.

Moreover, AI can automate mundane tasks that take up a lot of time and resources, allowing you to focus on more important things. This automation can lead to increased efficiency and productivity, and ultimately, better results.

All in all, amount of information is exponentially growing and to process it with given brain becoming harder and harder, almost impossible. 

## Benefits of AI

Learning how to use AI can bring numerous benefits. 

One of the most significant benefits is improved decision-making. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that would be impossible for humans to detect. This can help you make better-informed decisions and stay ahead of the competition.

Another benefit of AI is increased efficiency. AI-powered automation can help you streamline your operations and reduce costs. For example, chatbots can be used to handle customer inquiries, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex tasks.

If we talk about chatGPT or any other alternatives to it, this AI works as a multiplier for your brain. When you stuck with some ideas, or need to rephrase your thoughts, make your story shorter or more detailed and of course check your grammar and writing. It does writing way fast than you do, and there was already a similar story in the past.

Protests by some math teachers in the United States against the use of calculators in the classroom, specifically graphing calculators, in 1988.

The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics had recommended the use of calculators in the classroom since the early 1970s, but some educators were concerned that relying too heavily on calculators would hinder students' ability to develop fundamental math skills. They also argued that students would become too reliant on calculators and would not learn how to perform calculations manually.

The protests were sparked by the decision of the College Board, which oversees the SAT and other standardized tests, to allow the use of graphing calculators on the math section of the SAT. Some math teachers felt that this decision would encourage students to rely too heavily on calculators and would lead to a decline in the quality of math education.

However, over time, the use of calculators has become more accepted in the classroom and is now seen as an essential tool for learning math and science. The protests of 1988 have largely been forgotten, and the use of technology in education continues to evolve and expand.

> Same going to happen with AI, faster you accept this fact is better. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, AI is no longer a miracle or a dream but a necessity. The benefits of AI are vast and can help you and your business stay with the competition. By identifying the areas where AI can bring the most significant benefits, choosing the right tools, and having the right talent in place, you can start reaping the rewards of AI today.
