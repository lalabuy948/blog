I started noticing that nowadays with enormous amount of distractions it's incredibly hard to focus on things. And I was researching how people with ADHD actually staying hyper-focused, because fo them it must be even harder. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - ADHD can make it difficult to stay focused and productive, but there are strategies that I found useful and I will share them with you, which can help you stop procrastination and start getting things done even if you don't have ADHD but facing lack of focus. Here are some tips on how to be productive with ADHD and how to trick your brain into staying on task:

1. Create a structured schedule: Having a routine and structure in your day can help keep you on track. Make a schedule and try to stick to it as much as possible. Include breaks and relaxation time in your schedule to avoid burnout.

2. Use a timer: Set a timer for a specific amount of time to work on a task and then take a break. This can help you stay focused and motivated.

First two, do not work for me, each time I book myself a slot, it ends up in me doing completely other tasks rather the ones for which I booked a time slot. 

3. Break tasks into smaller steps: Large tasks can be overwhelming for individuals with ADHD. Breaking tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps can make them seem less daunting and help you stay focused.

Up for now, this is the most effective technique which helps me to do 100% of my capacity. One of the crucial things to follow this process, tool which you are using for the tasks management must be as simple as possible, otherwise you won't insert all todos and end up with chaos and even bigger backlog.

4. Remove distractions: Identify what distracts you and try to remove those distractions from your workspace. For example, if social media is a distraction, consider blocking those websites during work time.

6. Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness practices, such as meditation, can help improve focus and reduce stress levels. Take a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness and clear your mind.

Try to not listen music while you going somewhere or in public transport, just have 15 minutes for yourself. That might help as well. 

7. Reward yourself: Set goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. This can help motivate you to stay on task and work towards your goals.
