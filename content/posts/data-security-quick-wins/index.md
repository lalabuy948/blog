Data security is a critical concern for any industry, but it's especially important in digital company. With so much sensitive information being exchanged between different parties, it's essential to have robust security measures in place to protect against malicious attacks and data breaches.

So what are some best practices and tips for ensuring data security in digital company? First and foremost, it's important to implement strong access controls and encryption methods to protect data both in transit and at rest. This can include measures such as multi-factor authentication, VPNs, and SSL encryption. All our dev environments are hidden under VPN and password protected.

Another key best practice is to establish clear data governance policies and procedures. This can include policies around data classification, access controls, and incident response. All credit card numbers, company data or any other sensitive data such as clients data, must be exchanged only through 2 way inscription channel. And each position in the company should have corresponding access role, which has defined access levels and which data is visible to assigned role.

Since some companies serve to a large number of clients and receive or exchange a lot of sensitive data, such as addresses, emails, and personal details, you must ensure that none of that data can be accessed. To achieve this, I suggest to run periodic security penetration tests with the help of external white hat expert companies.

Finally, it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments especially in data security. Tech-debt can be not only annoying for developers, but as quite dangerous for the company. If you have non up to date library, framework or third-party tool, it can lead to data breaches, especially when vulnerabilities are found in them.
