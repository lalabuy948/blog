*For Digital Nomads, Freelancers, and Remote Business Owners*

*Non US Citizens only* 

## 1. Set Up Your Tax-Free Business Entity

### Step 1: Form a US LLC

**Why?** US LLCs are flexible, low-cost, and avoid corporate tax if structured correctly.

**How?**

- **Choose a State:**
  - Wyoming (no state tax, privacy)
  - Delaware (strong legal framework)
  - New Mexico (cheapest, but less banking flexibility)
- **Hire a Registered Agent:** Required for compliance (cost: $50-300/year)
- **Obtain an EIN:** Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) via IRS Form SS-4 (free)

### Alternative Structures:

- **UAE Free Zone Company:** 0% corporate/personal tax, but higher setup costs (~$15k)
- **Estonia e-Residency:** 0% corporate tax until profits are distributed

## 2. Terminate Tax Residency

### Step 2: Become a Tax Nomad

**Why?** Most countries tax residents on worldwide income.

**How?**

- Spend <183 days/year in any single country
- Sever ties to your home country (sell/rent property, close local bank accounts)
- Establish residency in a tax-free country (e.g., UAE, Georgia, Panama)

**Example:**
- Live in Thailand (180 days), UAE (90 days), and Mexico (95 days)

## 3. Open Business Bank Accounts

### Step 3: Set Up Banking for the LLC

**Why?** To receive payments and avoid mixing personal/business funds.

**How?**

- **US Business Account:** Use Mercury, Wise, or Payoneer (supports non-residents)
- **Non-US Account:** Open a USD account in a tax-neutral jurisdiction (e.g., UAE, Singapore)

> **Tip:** Use Wise to hold multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP) and avoid FX fees.

## 4. Invoice Clients & Receive Payments

### Step 4: Bill Clients Through the LLC

**Why?** Income must be routed through the LLC to qualify as non-taxable.

**How?**

- Invoice as the LLC: Use tools like FreshBooks or Wave
- Payment Processors: Stripe, PayPal, or direct bank transfers to the LLC's account
- Label Income as Non-ECI: Ensure services are performed outside the US for non-US clients

**Example:**
- A German client pays your Wyoming LLC $10,000 via Wise for freelance work done in Bali

## 5. Withdraw Profits Tax-Free

### Step 5: Pay Yourself as the Director/Owner

**Why?** Owner's draws are not taxed in the US if income is non-ECI.

**How?**

- **Owner's Draws:** Transfer profits from the LLC's account to your personal account
- **No Salary:** Avoid payroll taxes (15.3% in the US) by not paying yourself a salary
- **Use a Tax-Free Personal Account:** Withdraw funds to a UAE, Georgia, or Seychelles account (0% personal income tax)

**Example:**
- Transfer $50,000 from your Wyoming LLC's Mercury account to your UAE personal account
- Tax Result: 0% US tax (non-ECI income) + 0% UAE tax (0% personal tax)

## 6. Compliance & Reporting

### Step 6: Stay Legal

**US Requirements:**
- File Form 5472 annually (reports LLC transactions, even if $0 tax owed)
- Avoid creating a US tax nexus (no US office/clients)

**Non-US Requirements:**
- Report foreign accounts (e.g., FBAR for US citizens)
- Declare non-residency in your home country

**Tools:**
- Accounting: QuickBooks or Xero
- Tax Residency Tracker: Nomad Tax or Rovva

## 7. Advanced Tactics to Avoid Pitfalls

### Avoid Taxation Triggers:

- **No US Clients:** Work for non-US clients only
- **No Physical Presence:** Perform services outside the US and avoid staying >183 days/year in any country
- **No Passive Income:** Focus on active income (services, consulting). Passive income (royalties, dividends) may trigger CFC rules

**Example of Failure:**
- Working 200 days/year in Spain → Become a Spanish tax resident (global income taxed at 24-47%)

### Alternative Tax-Free Structures

#### Option 1: UAE Free Zone Company + Residency
- Set up a Dubai Free Zone Company (0% tax)
- Invoice clients globally
- Withdraw profits to your UAE personal account (0% tax)

#### Option 2: Estonia e-Residency + Cyprus Non-Dom
- Bill clients through an Estonian OÜ (0% corporate tax on retained earnings)
- Withdraw dividends as a Cyprus non-dom (0% tax on dividends)

#### Option 3: Puerto Rico Act 60
- Move to Puerto Rico (183+ days/year)
- Pay 4% corporate tax and 0% federal tax on US-source income

## Tax-Free Checklist

- [ ] Terminate tax residency in high-tax countries
- [ ] Use a US LLC/UAE company for invoicing
- [ ] Keep income as non-ECI (non-US clients, work done abroad)
- [ ] Withdraw profits via owner's draws (not salary)
- [ ] File Form 5472 (US) and report non-residency elsewhere

## Final Notes

- **Tax Avoidance vs. Evasion:** This scheme is legal if you follow residency rules and reporting requirements
- **Consult Professionals:** Hire a US tax attorney and international tax advisor to avoid mistakes
- **Adapt as Needed:** If your income or lifestyle changes (e.g., US clients), restructure immediately

*By following these steps, you can legally retain ~100% of your income while living and working globally.*
