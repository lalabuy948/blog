### Dead Cells

My top 1 is [Dead Cells](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/dead-cells/id1389752090). But to play it properly with full joy you need a game pad. DualShock is quite non compact, so 8bitdo can do it work perfectly. 

### Bad north

[Bad north](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/bad-north-jotunn-edition/id1367121168), ideal for non game pad gameplay, but works nicely with Apple magic keyboard.

### This war of mine

[This war of mine](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/this-war-of-mine/id982175678), this game took me through a lot of interesting stories, definitely recommend. 

### Iron hide

All games from [“Iron hide”](https://www.ironhidegames.com/Games). Perfect time killers, no internet required.

### Oddmar

[Oddmar](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/oddmar/id1247397901), surprisingly I missed that game back in the day, but when discovered I finished it within couple of flights. 

### Pocket Rogues

[Pocket Rogues](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/pocket-rogues/id1330488406), but again, much better with game pad. 

### One tappers

[Alto Odyssey](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/altos-odyssey/id1182456409) and Adventure, but I personally prefer ["Ski safari"](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ski-safari/id503092422), first version over second. 

## Apple Arcade section: 

Oddmar+, for those who has Apple Arcade, no need to purchase Oddmar, some time ago it became available in arcade. 

Castlevania, to be honest, the series is amazing, can entertain you for 8-10 flights (depends on flights duration), 4 seasons, around 8 episodes each. And game is super nice as well. 

Mini Metro+, again no need to purchase mini metro if you already got Apple Arcade

And mini motorways. 

Monument, for those who like puzzles instead of finger rushing.
