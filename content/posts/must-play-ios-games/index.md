After I started working from home I got a bit more time to play games and would like to share my favorite ones. There are a few criteria by which I was compiling these lists. First of all, games should be optimized for the iPhone and iPad, games shouldn't have bugs or unstable performance. And of course keep in mind that it's my taste and I would love to discover new projects - drop your favorite in comments below. 

## Best of the brightest

This is my the most favorite games which are pretty playable without the controller and have an amazing graphics. Majority of that games I played somewhere in the trips, plug headphones and you are ready. And I would open with post with Alto series. 

**[Alto's Adventure (5,49 â‚¬)](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/altos-adventure/id950812012) | [Alto's Odyssey (5,49 â‚¬)](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/altos-odyssey/id1182456409)**

I would love to add `Ski Safari` to `Alto` series as well, since they have common gameplay, but `Ski Safari` not optimized for the latest iOS devices and graphics not that good for nowadays.

`Odmar` is probably one of the best platformers I ever played, amazing characters, nice and kind story, and impressive gameplay. Gameplay not simple and not hardcore one it's pretty enjoyable. 

**[â€ŽOddmar (5,49 â‚¬)](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/oddmar/id1247397901)**

Let's continue with Vikings. The first time I tried `Bad North` on the laptop, after that I bought it once again on the iPhone. It's a nice real-time strategy slash tower defense, I dunno, there is no description of this kind of gameplay, but definitely worse to play it.

**[â€ŽBad North: Jotunn Edition (5,49 â‚¬)](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/bad-north-jotunn-edition/id1367121168)**

I was amazed by the next one. Its free, has full story mode available, online, with brilliant graphics and unique gameplay. I would rate it 10/10;

**[â€ŽSky: Children of the Light (free)](https://apps.apple.com/si/app/sky-children-of-the-light/id1462117269)**
