As you might feel hard times are approaching, failure of Silicon Valley Bank is not the only sign of what’s happening in the world. Enormous [true inflation](<[https://truflation.com](https://truflation.com/)>) with a lot of excluded spheres in calculations and constant lie on reported numbers. The main question is how to protect yourself from upcoming “tsunami”, as some enlightened people are saying.

Stocks, crypto, commodities, real estate, different currencies - all of this might evaporate in matter of a blink. Stocks unpredictable, crypto even worse. Commodities and real estate might nationalised. Any currency might hit hyper inflation or even if going to find a stable pair, you still need to do operations through banks which can refuse giving you real value back instead of digits on your phone screen.

## Highest ROI Asset?

Investing in yourself can lead to personal growth and development in a variety of ways. Pursuing formal education, taking courses or workshops, attending conferences, or even reading books can help you learn new skills, acquire knowledge, and gain valuable experiences. Exploring personal hobbies and interests can also help you discover new passions or hobbies that can open doors to new opportunities.

Investing in people, not just assets or stocks, can also lead to a successful bottom line. By understanding your strategy, listening to customer feedback, and having the best products and people, you can create a strong foundation for success. Hiring the right people, investing in their training and development, and fostering a positive and supportive work environment can also lead to increased productivity, employee satisfaction, and ultimately, a successful bottom line.

> Manage the top line, and the bottom line will follow. What's the top line? It's things like, why are we doing this in the first place? What's our strategy? What are customers saying? How responsive are we? Do we have the best products and the best people? Those are the kind of questions you have to focus on. – Steve Jobs

Furthermore, investing in yourself and others can help you build resilience and adaptability in uncertain times. The world is constantly changing, and unexpected challenges can arise at any moment. By investing in yourself, you can develop the skills and knowledge necessary to adapt to new situations and thrive in any environment. Similarly, investing in others can help you build a strong network of support and resources that can help you navigate challenges and overcome obstacles.

In summary, investing in yourself and others is a wise investment that can lead to personal growth and development, a successful bottom line, and resilience in uncertain times.

> "The secret of my success is that we have gone to exceptional lengths to hire the best people in the world." – Steve Jobs
