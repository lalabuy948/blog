### What Are Cookies

A cookie is a delicious sweet treat that you can eat. It's a small, round, and flat baked goodie that is often made with flour, sugar, eggs, and butter. Cookies come in many different shapes, sizes, and flavors. Some cookies are crispy and crunchy, while others are soft and chewy. Some have chocolate chips, nuts, or raisins in them, while others are decorated with frosting or sprinkles. People enjoy cookies as a snack or as a dessert, and they are often shared with friends and family.

### How We Use Cookies

Cookies are a fun and familiar treat that many kids have grown up enjoying, whether it's as an after-school snack, a special dessert, or a treat to share with friends. Here are a few reasons why kids might love cookies:

- Sweet taste: Cookies are often made with sugar or other sweeteners, which can make them very appealing to kids who have a sweet tooth.
- Variety of flavors: Cookies come in many different flavors, from classic chocolate chip to peanut butter to oatmeal raisin. This variety allows kids to find a cookie that they truly enjoy.
- Easy to eat: Cookies are often bite-sized or small enough to hold in your hand, making them easy for kids to eat and enjoy.

### Disabling Cookies

Cookies can be unhealthy if they are eaten in excess, as they are often high in sugar, fat, and calories. Here are a few reasons why eating too many cookies on a regular basis can be unhealthy and you might consider disabling some amount of cookies from your ration:

- High in sugar: Many cookies are made with a lot of sugar, which can lead to weight gain, tooth decay, and other health problems if consumed in excess.
- High in fat: Cookies are often made with butter or other fats, which can contribute to high cholesterol levels and an increased risk of heart disease if consumed in excess.
- Low in nutrients: Cookies are typically low in essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which can make it difficult to meet your daily nutrient needs if you rely on them as a regular part of your diet.

However, it's important to note that it's okay to enjoy cookies in moderation as part of a balanced diet. If you choose to indulge in cookies occasionally, it's a good idea to pair them with healthier foods like fruits and vegetables, and to pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overconsumption.

### The Cookies We Set

Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe.
Gather your ingredients, including flour, sugar, eggs, butter, and any other additions you'd like to include, such as chocolate chips or nuts.
In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until they are light and fluffy. This helps to create a smooth texture in the cookies.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and any other dry ingredients your recipe calls for.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until a dough forms. If you're adding any additional ingredients like chocolate chips or nuts, you can add them in now and mix them into the dough.
Drop spoonfuls of the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat, spacing them a few inches apart.
Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for the time specified in your recipe, until they are lightly golden brown on the edges.
Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
