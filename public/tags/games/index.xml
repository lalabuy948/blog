      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s finally released 🎉 Use for social media: &lt;code&gt;#MiniSpaceJourney&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mini-space-journey/id1665989118?itsct=apps_box_badge&amp;amp;itscg=30200&#34; style=&#34;display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/download-on-the-app-store/black/en-us?size=250x83&amp;amp;releaseDate=1674345600&#34; alt=&#34;Download on the App Store&#34; style=&#34;border-radius: 13px; width: 250px; height: 83px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mini Space Journey&amp;rdquo; is an innovative game for the Apple Watch that takes players on a thrilling adventure through outer space. Instead of using the watch&amp;rsquo;s accelerometer and gyroscope, the game utilizes the unique crown button on the side of the watch to navigate the player&amp;rsquo;s spacecraft. This makes for a unique and interactive gaming experience that is not found in other Apple Watch games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Look dear readers, I’m not even suppose to write such an articles, since I’m an inspiring manager and have to motivate people becoming better and so on. I not going to lie right, manager in IT department has nothing to do with people motivation or being a great example for productivity. I play games and fuck it, I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to fly quite a lot and still do and I was constantly looking for on-the-go solutions. For a while I was happy with iPad, but all the games there mostly arcade with zero story. Then I invested in Asus Rog Flow Z13, i9 and 3050ti on-the-fly sounds good right? Yeah, 1h of play for extra 3kilos on my back. This is so niche product that I’m still trying to sell it for half price.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After I started working from home I got a bit more time to play games and would like to share my favorite ones. There are a few criteria by which I was compiling these lists. First of all, games should be optimized for the iPhone and iPad, games shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have bugs or unstable performance. And of course, keep in mind that it&amp;rsquo;s my taste and I would love to discover new projects - drop your favorite in comments below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
